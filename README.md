```lrc
[00:38.23] For so long, I've been looking down
[00:43.94] Counting cracks on the pavement
[00:46.96] Chasing steps on the ground
[00:51.49] I see light, moving from behind the clouds
[00:58.78] I'm ready to fight so I don't fall, so I don't drown
[01:05.60] I'm not looking back
[01:08.90] On this life, this time
[01:13.06] Don't you dare look back
[01:16.35] With regret, tonight
[01:20.59] I'm not looking back
[01:35.59] I'm not looking back
[01:50.63] I'm not looking back
[01:53.80] On this life, this time
[01:58.06] Don't you dare look back
[02:01.39] With regret, tonight
[02:11.39] 
[02:08.37] Don't let your tears drown out your dreams
[02:13.29] Cause it will be alright
[02:15.84] Just take a moment here to breath
[02:21.00] Open your eyes
[02:23.62] The worlds brighter than it seems
[02:29.00] Heart to sky
[02:30.81] Watching it fly, cant you see?
[02:34.83] Ohh
[02:35.60] I'm not looking back
[02:38.83] On this life, this time
[02:43.05] Don't you dare look back
[02:46.30] With regret, tonight
[02:50.52] I'm not looking back
[03:05.52] I'm not looking back
[03:20.65] I'm not looking back
[03:23.82] On this life, this time
[03:28.06] Don't you dare look back
[03:31.30] With regret, tonight
[03:41.30]
